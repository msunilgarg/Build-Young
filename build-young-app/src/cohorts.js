// ============================ COHORTS (dependency-free) ============================
//
// The cohort catalog (SEASONS + BATCHES + CHECKINS). Kept React/lucide-free so the serverless
// cron scheduler (api/cron/market-news.js) and the funnel module can import the SAME source of
// truth. App.jsx imports + re-exports these unchanged.
//
// Build Young runs ONE combined high-school track — "Builders". Each cohort meets TWICE a
// week (~3 hrs/week, two 90-min sessions) over the 12-week course; we run two cohorts per season
// on alternating day-pairs (Mon & Wed, Tue & Thu) so families can self-select a schedule.
//
// Each BATCH:
//   - id      — stable cohort id used in URLs + the roster (e.g. "fall-mw")
//   - season  — SEASONS key (groups the enroll dropdown + landing pills)
//   - track   — cohort label; "Builders" for all (single combined track)
//   - start   — WEEK 1 class date, e.g. "Sep 7, 2026" (Date-parseable). Week N's anchor is
//               start + (N-1)*7 days. The weekdays are echoed in `day`.
//   - day     — human label, e.g. "Mondays & Wednesdays · 5:00–6:30 PM PT"
//   - seats / price / zoom — enrollment + class details
//   - lessons (OPTIONAL) — the cohort's PACE: an array (one entry per 3-hr LESSON) of that lesson's
//                live-sitting day-offsets from `start`, e.g. `[[0,2],[7,9], …]`. 12 lessons = 36 hrs
//                (invariant); sittings-per-lesson is flexible (a lesson may be one 3-hr slot `[d]` or
//                two 90-min sittings `[d, d+2]` or more). Omit it for the flagship cadence (12 lessons,
//                twice-weekly day-pair → `[[0,2],[7,9], …, [77,79]]`); supply it for an accelerated
//                cohort (more lessons/week → fewer calendar weeks). All calendar/progression/refund
//                math derives from it — see `cohortLessons` in courseDates.js.
//   - manualLesson (OPTIONAL) — founder progress override: 0/absent = AUTO (follow the calendar),
//                1..12 = the cohort is on that lesson, 13 = graduated. The dashboard reads
//                `effectivePosition` (this when set, else the calendar) — see courseDates.js.

// Follow-up check-ins after the 12-week course. The program is now 12 weeks flat — the finale is
// the Week 12 capstone (no separate check-in call, no tuition prize) — so this is 0. Kept as a
// constant (not deleted) so the funnel/analytics + sim harness stay generic if it ever returns.
